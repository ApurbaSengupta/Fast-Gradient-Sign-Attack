# Fast-Gradient-Sign-Attack

Attacking a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) having ReLU activations with adversarial images generated using Fast Gradient Sign Attack (FGSM) techniques (both un-targeted and targeted), thus exposing threats to a highly confident CNN. 

Utilized PyTorch framework for development. Used Google Colaboratory to use GPU while training the model.
